# Heart Disease Prediction Model

    Project Overview
    This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients. 
    We utilize a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle containing various cardiovascular health indicators to train and evaluate our predictive model.

# Dataset #

The dataset used in this project is the "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" from Kaggle. 
It includes the following features:
- Age
- Sex
- ChestPainType
- RestingBP
- Cholesterol
- FastingBS
- RestingECG
- MaxHR
- ExerciseAngina
- Oldpeak
- ST_Slope
- HeartDisease (target variable)
